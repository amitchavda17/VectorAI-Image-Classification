#Vector image classification API 
make a virtual enviornment and install the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
A) Build Image Classifier and Library
1) Fashion MNIST image classifier :
   Trained a custom image classifier to classify fashion mnist images please refer
   [here](Fashion_mnist.ipynb)

2)  Vector_ML  Library/API to automate building and testing Classification Model:
    ```python
    Vector_ML\Vector_CNN
    
    class VectorCNN : library for building image classification which uses tf.keras
    ```
    Launch docsumo_text_classification.ipynb 
3) Testing the Vector_ML Library to build models:
    [vector_ml](mnist_classifier_vectorML.ipynb)

B) API to send receive messages via message brokers:
    #TODO

C) Serve ML models using message broking
    #TODO
